# Level 2: Rotating shapes

> What is the most important behavior, which is not yet implemented?

> You can't have a Tetris without rotating tetrominoes. As a [stepping stone](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/responsive-design/)
> for that, let's create an algorithm which rotates arbitrary 3Ã—3 and 5Ã—5 block shapes. That should cover the needs of

Open the [test/RotatingShapes.test.mjs](../test/RotatingShapes.test.mjs) file and implement its tests one by one.

The `RotatingShape` class is meant to be [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).
