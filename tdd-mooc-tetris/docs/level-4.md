# Level 4: Falling tetrominoes

> Previously we have implemented falling blocks and rotating tetrominoes. Let's put them now together.

Open the [test/FallingTetrominoes.test.mjs](../test/FallingTetrominoes.test.mjs) file and implement its tests one by
one.

The `Board` class needs to be updated to work with complex block shapes. It may be useful to temporarily disable the one
failing test, so that you can refactor on green.

When refactoring, it's important to work in small steps and run the tests after every change. If it has been more than a
few minutes since the tests last passed, you're about to enter [refactoring hell](https://wiki.c2.com/?RefactoringHell),
and it's faster to revert to the last known working state (`git reset --hard`) and try again with even smaller steps.
